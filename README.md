Welcome to our GitHub page where you can see selected components of our code. 
We are one of the rare ICOs that have a live and working product (that even has lead users already using it) - therefore we invite you to check out the live platform at www.EnergyPremier.com. 
You are of course still welcome to check out the GitHub page, but we think that you have the unique and rare opportunity to check out the real product, play with it and get a feel for it - which may be even more useful for your research on our ICO. 
Please understand that we could not publish our full code as we want to protect the IP as well as ensure the security of both the platform as well as the token owners.
